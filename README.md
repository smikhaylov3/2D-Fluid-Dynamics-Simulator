This creates a 2D Fluid/Smoke simulator by following a grid based approach. The advection of velocity is solved by foloowing
the semi-Lagrange method for solving partial differential equations. But that all boring. Use your left mouse button to draw 
on the screen, push the 'c' key to cycle colors, use the right mouse button to add forces from any direction to the vector 
field and if you're a nerd push the 'v' key to see the underlying vector field and see just the underlying velocities,
with no pesky colors.
A video demo is available in this repo as well.
The project has bouth the source code and an executable, so enjoy!
